# views

Eventually consistent external materialized views for SQL databases.

## Usage

TODO

## Testing

You will need to set up the test db to run the tests:

```bash
$ psql -Upostgres < test/views/test_db.sql
CREATE ROLE
CREATE DATABASE
$
```

This will create a role `views_user` and a database owned by that user called `views_test`.

(You can change the database settings if you'd like by editing that file and checking the config in `test/views/fixtures.clj`.)

Then, to run all tests:

```bash
$ lein with-profile test test
```
